# art_portfolio_website
An example website, created while learning HTML5, CSS, and other related things for the first time. 
The website is an online art portfolio.

Listed below are the tutorials and online courses used that I learned from to create the website. 
For every commit/change to the master branch, the lessons used will be posted and linked to in this readme.
For details about the changes to the website itself, the commit messages will be a more useful description.

Please note that not all the tutorials will be accessible. Some of them come from Udemy and Lynda, online courses
that require registration. If that happens, the name of the course, what part of the course, and the instructor's 
name will be put down instead of a direct link.
